				One of my favorite video games is Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I used to main Cloud, but I grew tired of his poor recovery and lack of projectiles, so I opted for Donkey Kong, a character that has an even worse recovery and zero projectiles. #5dchess Now, even if I wanted to get extremely good at the game, I feel that I have put a ceiling on my proficiency at the game because I have chosen one of the worst characters in the entire game, and even being fantastically skilled at the game would not allow me to beat mediocre characters that are even somewhat close to being top-tier. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

				The UW basketball team has been difficult to watch this year. They have been at the bottom (or near the bottom) of the Pac12 for the entirety of the season. Coach Hopkins is not getting it done, and with little revenue coming into the UW athletic dept due to no in-person attendance (thanks COVID), it is unlikely that the Athletic Director would be able to fire him even if she wanted to. Coach Hopkins has a massive contract since his first two seasons at UW were very successful; hopefully he is able to replicate some of that success in the coming seasons.
